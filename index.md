# Workshop Theme and Goals

Large Storage Systems and Storage Area Networks (SANs) are emerging as a prominent and independent layer of IT infrastructure in enterprise class and midrange computing environments. To accelerate the emergence of more functional and sophisticated storage systems in the market, the industry requires a standard management interface that allows different classes of hardware and software products supplied by multiple vendors to reliably and seamlessly interoperate for the purpose of monitoring and controlling resources. This interface is targeted at creating broad multi-vendor management interoperability and thus increasing customer satisfaction. To that end, many standard defines an "open" and extensible interface that allows subsystems and devices within the global context of a large storage system to be reliably and securely managed by overlying presentation frameworks and management systems in the context of the rapidly evolving multi-vendor market. In specific, SAN integrators (like end-users, VARs, and SSPs) can, via this standardized management interface, more flexibly select between multiple vendors when building the hierarchy of software systems required to manage a large storage system independent of the underlying hardware systems. Additionally, storage integrators can more flexibly select between alternate hardware vendors when constructing storage configurations.

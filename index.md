title: ITSMS Workshop
description: The First International Workshop on Information Technology Storage Management Specification
---

# Workshop Theme and Goals

Large Storage Systems and Storage Area Networks (SANs) are emerging as a prominent and independent layer of IT infrastructure in enterprise class and midrange computing environments. To accelerate the emergence of more functional and sophisticated storage systems in the market, the industry requires a standard management interface that allows different classes of hardware and software products supplied by multiple vendors to reliably and seamlessly interoperate for the purpose of monitoring and controlling resources. This interface is targeted at creating broad multi-vendor management interoperability and thus increasing customer satisfaction. To that end, many standard defines an "open" and extensible interface that allows subsystems and devices within the global context of a large storage system to be reliably and securely managed by overlying presentation frameworks and management systems in the context of the rapidly evolving multi-vendor market. In specific, SAN integrators (like end-users, VARs, and SSPs) can, via this standardized management interface, more flexibly select between multiple vendors when building the hierarchy of software systems required to manage a large storage system independent of the underlying hardware systems. Additionally, storage integrators can more flexibly select between alternate hardware vendors when constructing storage configurations.

      <strong>Abstract: </strong> Storage management has become one of the most important technical keys in the field of data storage, which is mainly due to the high cost and growing demand in data managing. Specifically reflected in the deployment and application of storage network infrastructure, it poses a great challenge to the performance, function, security and reliability of network storage system, followed by the large-scale and complexity of storage system, resulting in the higher cost of data management. The storage management standard will be effectively helpful in solving the interoperability and cross regional management of multi-functional complex storage architecture.<br/>

      </div>
      <strong>Abstract: </strong> With the rapid increase of heterogeneous storage systems for WAN, the management interfaces of these storage resources are different and difficult to manage uniformly.Meanwhile, the current storage management standard SMI-S (Storage Management Initiative specification) is a standard suitable for LAN. SMI-S  is difficult to effectively collect and maintain the storage resource information under the whole WAN. This talk introduces an extension method of the managment architecture of SMI-S for WAN, based on a structured peer-to-peer network.<br/>

      <strong>Abstract: </strong> For a long time, the key storage applications and high performance requirements are mainly based on FC networks. The emergence of new NVMe technologies brings new opportunities. Ethernet-base NVMe is an implementation of NVMe over Fabric that best fits NVMe semantics. It surpasses FC in terms of performance, cost. It is the development trend of high-speed storage networks in the future. But unlike FC, Ethernet lack a discovery service that enables the automatic addition of nodes to the fabric. And unlink FC, Ethernet switch does not have zone management and does not notify the change of device status. When the device is faulty, the host takes tens of seconds to complete service switchover. This document proposes a proactive notification mechanism of device information and status to enhance the usability and reliability of Ethernet-based NVMe.<br/>

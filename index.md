description: The First International Workshop on Information Technology Storage Management Specification

# Workshop Theme and Goals

Large Storage Systems and Storage Area Networks (SANs) are emerging as a prominent and independent layer of IT infrastructure in enterprise class and midrange computing environments. To accelerate the emergence of more functional and sophisticated storage systems in the market, the industry requires a standard management interface that allows different classes of hardware and software products supplied by multiple vendors to reliably and seamlessly interoperate for the purpose of monitoring and controlling resources. This interface is targeted at creating broad multi-vendor management interoperability and thus increasing customer satisfaction. To that end, many standard defines an "open" and extensible interface that allows subsystems and devices within the global context of a large storage system to be reliably and securely managed by overlying presentation frameworks and management systems in the context of the rapidly evolving multi-vendor market. In specific, SAN integrators (like end-users, VARs, and SSPs) can, via this standardized management interface, more flexibly select between multiple vendors when building the hierarchy of software systems required to manage a large storage system independent of the underlying hardware systems. Additionally, storage integrators can more flexibly select between alternate hardware vendors when constructing storage configurations. 


# Call for paper

Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- **Computer interface definition, such as Filesystems, Block devices, Fabric, Network.**
- **Storage technology standards, such as Cache, Non-Volatile Memory systems.**
- **Building distributed storage systems on high-speed networks such as RDMA.**
- **Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and secure systems.**

# Submissions

Submissions can be done via [**EasyChair**](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itsms2022).

ITSMS will be a full-day workshop with a single (no parallel) session, with at least 1 keynote and up to 2 invited presentations. Submitted papers should follow [the 2-column ACM conference](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) publication style and not exceed 6 pages (including references). Submissions can be research papers, position papers, case studies, or experience reports addressing above topics. Accepted papers will be published in the ICPE companion.

# Important Dates (AOE)

The accepted papers will be published in the ICPE 2022 Proceedings using the two-column ACM format. We propose the following tentative dates for the workshop:

1. **Paper submission: Jan 20, 2022**
2. **Acceptance Notification: Feb 15, 2022**
3. **Camera ready: Feb 20, 2022**

**All deadlines are 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).**

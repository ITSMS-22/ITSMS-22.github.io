# ITSMS 2022 

The First International Workshop on Information Technology Storage Management Specification  
at [ICPE 2022](https://icpe2022.spec.org/).

## Workshop Theme and Goals

Large Storage Systems and Storage Area Networks (SANs) are emerging as a prominent and independent layer of IT infrastructure in enterprise class and midrange computing environments. Examples of applications and functions driving the emergence of new storage technology include:

- Sharing of vast storage resources between multiple systems via networks,- LAN free backup,
- Remote, disaster tolerant, on-line mirroring of mission critical data,
- Clustering of fault tolerant applications and related systems around a single copy of data.
- Archiving requirements for sensitive business information.
- Distributed database and file systems.

To accelerate the emergence of more functional and sophisticated storage systems in the market, the industry requires a standard management interface that allows different classes of hardware and software products supplied by multiple vendors to reliably and seamlessly interoperate for the purpose of monitoring and controlling resources. This standard provides for heterogeneous, functionally rich, reliable, and secure monitoring/control of mission critical global resources in complex and potentially broadly-distributed, multi-vendor storage topologies like SANs. As such, this interface overcomes the deficiencies associated with legacy management systems that deter customer uptake of more advanced storage management systems.
This interface is targeted at creating broad multi-vendor management interoperability and thus increasing customer satisfaction. To that end, this standard defines an “open” and extensible interface that allows subsystems and devices within the global context of a large storage system to be reliably and securely managed by overlying presentation frameworks and management systems in the context of the rapidly evolving multi-vendor market. In specific, SAN integrators (like end-users, VARs, and SSPs) can, via this standardized management interface, more flexibly select between multiple vendors when building the hierarchy of software systems required to manage a large storage system independent of the underlying hardware systems. Additionally, storage integrators can more flexibly select between alternate hardware vendors when constructing storage configurations. Broad adoption of the standards defined and extended in this standard will provide increased customer satisfaction and will:
- more rapidly expand the acceptance of new storage management technology like SANs
and iSCSI; 
- accelerate customer acquisition of new storage management technology;
- expand the total market.


## Call for paper

Topics of interest for the workshop include, but are not limited to:
- Common profiles and storage subsystem-level management interface
- Contains storage configuration files that support various forms of disk storage.
- Contains configuration files that support file systems, such as NAS (Network Attached Storage).
- Contains configuration files that handle the interconnection of host servers and storage devices, such as switches.
- Contains configuration files for storage software on the host server, such as disk partitions and host hardware RAID controllers.
- Contains configuration files for handling removable media, such as tape libraries.

## Submissions

Submissions can be done via EasyChair (*coming soon*).

ITSMS will be a full-day workshop with a single (no parallel) session, with at least 1 keynote and up to 2 invited presentations. Submitted papers should follow the 2-column ACM conference (https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) publication style and not exceed 6 pages (including references). Submissions can be research papers, position papers, case studies, or experience reports addressing above topics. Accepted papers will be published in the ICPE companion.

## Important Dates (AOE)

The accepted papers will be published in the ICPE 2022 Proceedings using the two-column ACM format. We propose the following tentative dates for the workshop:
1. Paper submission: Jan 10, 2022
2. Reviews due: Feb 10, 2022
3. Acceptance Notification: Feb 15, 2022
4. Camera ready: Feb 20, 2022

All deadlines are 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).
